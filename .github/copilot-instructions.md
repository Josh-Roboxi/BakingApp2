# BakingApp - Copilot Instructions

This is a modern React web application for managing baking recipes and techniques.

## Project Context
BakingApp is designed to help bakers organize recipes, track ingredient measurements, manage baking techniques, and store notes about their baking experiments. The application focuses on providing a clean, intuitive interface for both amateur and professional bakers.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7.2.1  
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: CSS Modules (expandable to styled-components or Tailwind)
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Code Quality**: ESLint with TypeScript support

## Development Guidelines
- Use functional components with React hooks
- Follow TypeScript strict mode practices
- Implement responsive design patterns for mobile-first approach
- Use semantic HTML elements for accessibility
- Follow React component composition patterns
- Organize components in feature-based folders
- Use CSS Modules for component-scoped styling
- Implement proper error boundaries for robust error handling
- Write clean, self-documenting code with meaningful variable names

## Code Organization
- `/src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- `/src/pages/` - Main application pages/views
- `/src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `/src/utils/` - Utility functions and helpers
- `/src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `/src/assets/` - Static assets (images, icons, etc.)

## Coding Preferences  
- Prefer arrow functions for components
- Use explicit return types for functions when beneficial
- Implement proper prop typing with interfaces
- Use meaningful component and function names
- Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components)
- Add JSDoc comments for complex logic
